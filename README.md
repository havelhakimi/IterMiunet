# IterMiUnet: A lightweight architecture for automatic blood vessel segmentation
Model Checkpoints to reproduce the results for the journal paper  "IterMiUnet: A lightweight architecture for automatic blood vessel segmentation" [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01485) [journal](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-023-15433-7)
* Since this is an old work standalone keras 2.2.4 was used while training the models as opposed tf.keras which comes integrated with tensorflow now.
* The jupyter notebook inside Stare folder can be run using the older version of standalone keras
* We have shared model checkpoints for stare dataset in `Stare\Models`
